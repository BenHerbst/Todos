# Todos
**Todos** is a guideline for a Todo file format.

To get starting, create a folder with the name **Todos**
Then create files for your projects: {project_name}.txt, or create a single file with the name **todos.txt**

It should looks like this:

Todos
  shopping_list.txt
  morning.txt
  ...
 
Then create a sub folder in the folder **Todos** with the name addons, there your cli will create Analystics, or Settings for the cli or other gui based programms will put their settings and other things their.

Then open a file.

To write a todo, first write the pioritys in square brackets. Then a space and after that in "" your task, then you can add time after a space. After that you can also add groups with @{group_name} or places with +{Street Number City Land}
